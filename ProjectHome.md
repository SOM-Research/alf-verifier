## What is Alf-verifier? ##

Alf-verifier is a lightweight tool for verifying the correctness of UML **executable models** complemented with operations described by means of the new OMG standard <a href='http://www.omg.org/spec/ALF/'>Alf Action Language</a>.

It can check the **executability** of such operations, i.e. if they are guaranteed to generate a consistent state after executing.

## How it works? ##

Alf-verifier works in an efficient way, since no simulation of the operations is required in order to verify its correctness.

## How it can help me? ##

If you are a software designer, this tool can help you to improve the quality of your models. For non-executable operations, the tool is able to identify the source of the inconsistency and suggest possible corrections to repair them.
