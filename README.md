# What is Alf-verifier?
Alf-verifier is a lightweight tool for verifying the correctness of UML executable models complemented with operations described by means of the new OMG standard Alf Action Language.
It can check the executability of such operations, i.e. if they are guaranteed to generate a consistent state after executing.

# How it works?
Alf-verifier works in an efficient way, since no simulation of the operations is required in order to verify its correctness.

# How it can help me?
If you are a software designer, this tool can help you to improve the quality of your models. For non-executable operations, the tool is able to identify the source of the inconsistency and suggest possible corrections to repair them.
